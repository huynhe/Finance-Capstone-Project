Exploration of Stocks for Major Banks

Quantitatively and visually explored stock data for 6 major banks (Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, 
JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) from 2006 to 2016.

Data was imported from the Google API and quantitatively analyzed using pandas.

Visualizations were drawn using matplotlib and seaborn. Additional interactive plots were done using
plotly, but the functionality has been lost.

An insight gained from the analysis was CitiGroup's stock split in May 2009 caused the worst and best return days
in the span of 10 years. Additionally, the day of President Barack Obama's inauguration, BAC, GS, JPM, and WFC all
experience their worst performing stock day.
